            <p>This is the Support Page, here you can find information on what each page contains, contact info and links to pages</p>

            <p><b>Home Page Description</b><br>
            The Home Page contains information on what Data Set has been provided, as well as the Project Vision. A description of the data set I have chosen
            can be seen at the top of the page, which informs you on what it contains and also provides the link to the original data set. I also provided a section to
            give some background to the project e.g. the project vision. This describes how the website became what it was and why it was created!</p>

            <p><b>Library Data Page Description</b><br>
                The Library Data Page contains the Plymouth's Library Data Set in a human readable format e.g. in tables and able to be understood. The user can view the Data Set here
            and gather information on Plymouth's various libraries and locations for them!</p>

            <p><b>Resource Page Description</b><br>
            The Resource Page is used in order to contain any Third Party content e.g. images, icons etc. and also to provide what I believe to be reasonable links to extra resources
            like Github, this can show you the source and the projects development process!</p>

            <p><b>Website Page Links</b><br>
                Below You can find some links which take you to various pages on the website!<br>
