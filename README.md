# COMP2001-Coursework-WebApplication
This repository will contain my URI (PHP) and API (ASP.NET) Applications for the COMP2001 Coursework

## Project Vision
The vision for this project consists of creating a web based application which has the ability to display data on Plymouth's Libraries e.g. Names, Addresses, Longitude/Latitude etc. The only difference is that this will be displayed in a human readable format. This means that you can easily understand the data being represented to you. If you wish to see this data, please visit the Library Data Page
